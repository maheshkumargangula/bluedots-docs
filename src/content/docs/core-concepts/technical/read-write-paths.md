Signals keeps **two read layers strictly separate**. Before writing a read endpoint, decide which layer it belongs to.

## Instance-local read

```http
GET /api/v1/item/fetch
```

Reads an instance's **own** items, backed by a brief Redis cache. Use this for "my own items" reads. It does **not** reach across the network.

## Inter-instance read

```http
GET /api/v1/network/item/fetch
```

Reads **across instances** using a *count-first discovery* strategy:

1. **Count first** — ask peer instances how many relevant items they hold.
2. **Select peers** — pick only the peers that actually have relevant items.
3. **Fetch slices** — request just the needed slices from those peers.
4. **Merge & cache** — combine results and cache the merged view. **Schema fetching and caching live in this layer**, not in the instance-local layer.

This avoids the naive "every instance queries every other" fan-out and is the core scaling decision of the network.

![A client calls GET /network/item/fetch on the Signals API, which counts across peer instances, picks only the relevant peers, fetches slices from them, then merges and caches (including the schema cache) into the merged result](../../../../assets/diagrams/read-write-network-fetch.png)

## Write paths

Writes into Signals are deliberately constrained:

- The **Signals UI / direct clients** create items through the authenticated session path.
- **Integrating DPGs** (Aggregator app, voice DPG) write through **controlled bulk-create paths** using the [two-header service-auth model](/bluedots-docs/core-concepts/architecture/identity-and-auth/). In the MVP the Aggregator has no other write access to Signals.
- On write, the backend generates `item_instance_url` and `item_schema_url`; clients cannot set them.

## Reliability rules for writes and external calls

Every external call (including cross-instance fetches and writes) must have an **explicit timeout, at least one retry with exponential backoff, and a typed error**. Routes never throw — they return `reply.code(N).send({ error, message })`, handling Postgres `23505` (unique violation) and `23503` (FK violation) explicitly.
