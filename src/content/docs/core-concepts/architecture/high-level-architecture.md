The Blue Dots stack is organised into clear horizontal layers, with two parallel verticals — **Aggregator** and **Signals** — that share datastores and integrations.

## The layered view

## Layer by layer

**Apps.** Two web front-ends. The **Aggregator App** is the organisation-facing portal for onboarding and bulk upload. The **Signals App** is the schema-driven UI that renders forms and cards directly from network and item schemas.

**Auth.** The two verticals use different identity systems by design: the Aggregator stack uses **Keycloak** (OIDC, realm `aggregator`), while the Signals stack uses **Better-Auth** with an additional API-key path for integrating DPGs. See [Identity & Auth](/bluedots-docs/core-concepts/architecture/identity-and-auth/).

**API.** The **Aggregator API** is a Fastify backend-for-frontend that owns the aggregator database and the registration/approval/bulk-upload flows. The **Signals API** is the network-aware Fastify backend that owns items, actions, events and cross-instance discovery.

**Datastores.** Shared across both verticals:
- **PostgreSQL** — system of record (Drizzle ORM; item tables are partitioned in Signals).
- **Redis** — sessions, caches and the background-job queue.
- **Object Storage (S3)** — bulk-upload files and assets. S3 is a real cloud dependency, not part of the local Docker stack.

**Integrations.** **SMTP** for email (Mailpit locally) and **SMS** for notifications and OTP delivery.

**Ingress & platform (cloud).** In a cloud deployment, a shared `common-services` layer fronts both verticals with a **Kong** ingress controller and provisions cert-manager (TLS) and the shared Postgres + Redis. How this is provisioned and deployed is covered in [Infrastructure & Deployment Architecture](/bluedots-docs/core-concepts/architecture/infrastructure/).

## Two verticals, one network

The Aggregator vertical is an **on-ramp**: it feeds participant signals into the Signals vertical, which is the **network**. In the MVP the Aggregator writes to Signals only through controlled bulk-create paths and otherwise reads from it.

```text
Aggregator App ─▶ Aggregator API ─▶ (bulk create) ─▶ Signals API ─▶ Network discovery
                                                          ▲
                                          Signals App ────┘
```
