Blue Dots separates **building** application images from **deploying** them. The application repositories build and publish container images; the `bluedots-automation` repository pins specific image versions and deploys them to a cluster. Understanding this split is the key to the whole delivery pipeline.

## The pipeline at a glance

```text
app repos (Signals-DPG, aggregator-dpg)
   │  GitHub Actions: lint · typecheck · test · build
   │  build Docker images, tag with sha-<short>
   ▼
GHCR  ghcr.io/blue-dots-economy/<service>:sha-<short>
   │
   │  pin tags in global-images.yaml (per environment)
   ▼
bluedots-automation  (OpenTofu/Terragrunt + Helm via install.sh)
   │  helm upgrade --install … -f global-images.yaml
   ▼
AWS EKS cluster  (common-services → signals → aggregator)
```

There are two distinct "CI/CD" surfaces:

1. **Application CI** — lives in each app repo. It validates and builds images.
2. **Delivery / CD** — lives in `bluedots-automation`. It provisions infrastructure and deploys pinned images with Helm.

## 1. Application CI (build & publish)

Each application repo runs GitHub Actions on every PR and on pushes:

- **Quality gates** — `pnpm -w lint`, `typecheck`, `test`, `build`, and (for `aggregator-dpg`) `pnpm dep-check`. Branch protection requires the `CI` check to pass before merge.
- **Image build & publish** — a Docker matrix builds one image per deployable service and publishes to **GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)** under `ghcr.io/blue-dots-economy/…`. Images are tagged with the commit short SHA (`sha-<short>`); some services also cut per-app release tags (e.g. `web-v*`, `api-v*`, `worker-v*`).

Representative images (Signals + Aggregator):

| Service | Image |
| --- | --- |
| Signals API | `ghcr.io/blue-dots-economy/signals-dpg/api` |
| Signals UI | `ghcr.io/blue-dots-economy/signals-dpg/ui` |
| Signals search | `ghcr.io/blue-dots-economy/signals-search` |
| Aggregator API | `ghcr.io/blue-dots-economy/aggregator-dpg/api` |
| Aggregator web | `ghcr.io/blue-dots-economy/aggregator-dpg/web` |
| Aggregator worker | `ghcr.io/blue-dots-economy/aggregator-dpg/worker` |
| Keycloak (custom) | `ghcr.io/blue-dots-economy/aggregator-dpg/keycloak-server` |

Third-party platform images (Postgres, Redis, cert-manager, Kong) come from their own registries and are pinned the same way.

## 2. Pinning images for a deployment

The `bluedots-automation` repo does not build images — it **selects** them. Each environment has its own `opentofu/aws/<env>/global-images.yaml`, the single source of truth for image `repository`, `tag` and `pullPolicy` across every service:

```yaml
# opentofu/aws/<env>/global-images.yaml  (excerpt)
api:
  image:
    repository: ghcr.io/blue-dots-economy/signals-dpg/api
    tag: "sha-46c05dd"          # ← promote by changing this
    pullPolicy: Always
web:
  image:
    repository: ghcr.io/blue-dots-economy/aggregator-dpg/web
    tag: "sha-15afbce"
    pullPolicy: Always
```

Because the file is **per-environment**, each deployment pins its own tags independently — dev can ride `sha-…` builds while a production environment stays on a known-good SHA. **Promoting a release = updating a tag here and re-running the deploy.** The keys map directly to subchart names in the umbrella Helm charts.

## 3. Delivery (CD) with `install.sh`

Deployment is driven by `opentofu/aws/<env>/install.sh` — one script for both cloud bootstrap and Helm deploy (there is **no Makefile**). Every `deploy_*` function runs `helm upgrade --install … --wait`, layering the chart's own `values.yaml`, then the generated overlays, then `global-images.yaml` and `global-resources.yaml`.

```bash
cd opentofu/aws/<env>
export GHCR_PAT=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxx          # read:packages — needed to pull private images

# static checks (install nothing)
bash install.sh lint        # helm lint all charts
bash install.sh dry_run     # helm --dry-run against the cluster

# full, ordered deploy
bash install.sh deploy_all_services
```

`deploy_all_services` chains, in strict order:

```text
preflight
 → create_namespaces_and_secrets   (3 namespaces + ghcr-pull image-pull secret)
   → deploy_monitoring
     → deploy_common_services       (gp3 default SC + Kong CRDs + platform)
       → deploy_signals
         → deploy_aggregator
           → fix_acme_issuer_uri
```

See the [Deployment guide](/bluedots-docs/guides/deployment/) for the full step-by-step and validation, and [Infrastructure & Deployment Architecture](/bluedots-docs/core-concepts/architecture/infrastructure/) for what each layer is.

### Scripted / non-interactive runs

For automation (e.g. a future pipeline), the OpenTofu apply functions honour `AUTO_APPROVE=1` for non-interactive `terragrunt apply`, and `GHCR_PAT` can be supplied via the environment instead of an interactive prompt:

```bash
AUTO_APPROVE=1 GHCR_PAT=ghp_xxx bash install.sh apply_tf_eks
GHCR_PAT=ghp_xxx bash install.sh create_namespaces_and_secrets
```

## 4. Environments & branch strategy

Each live deployment has its **own long-lived branch** carrying that deployment's config — network schema, image tags, public hostnames, and its own `opentofu/aws/<env>/` directory. Work flows up a trunk chain before landing in a deployment branch.

**Trunk (promotion chain):** `<feature-branch>` → `feature` → `develop` → `main`.

- `main` — canonical branch; cut new deployment branches from here.
- `develop` — pre-release integration.
- `feature` — collects in-progress work (often the newest trunk branch).

**Per-deployment branches** (examples):

| Branch | Env | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `blue-dots-dev` | dev | |
| `orange-dots-dev` | dev | |
| `orange-dot-prod` | prod | |
| `purple-dots-prod` | prod | |

:::caution
Never deploy a customer environment from `main` — use that environment's branch. The branch carries the hostnames, image pins, and `opentofu/aws/<env>/` that make the deployment specific.

## 5. How a code change reaches a cluster

1. Open a PR in an app repo → CI runs lint/typecheck/test/build; reviewers approve.
2. Merge → the Docker matrix publishes `ghcr.io/blue-dots-economy/<service>:sha-<short>` to GHCR.
3. In `bluedots-automation`, on the target environment's branch, update the relevant tag(s) in `opentofu/aws/<env>/global-images.yaml`.
4. Run `bash install.sh deploy_<service>` (or `deploy_all_services`) — Helm rolls out the new image with `--wait`.
5. Validate (`helm list -A`, pod health, ingress, TLS) — see the [Deployment guide](/bluedots-docs/guides/deployment/).

Rollback is the inverse: set the tag back to the previous known-good SHA and re-run the deploy.
