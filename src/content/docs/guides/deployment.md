description: Provision AWS infrastructure and deploy the Blue Dots stack with OpenTofu/Terragrunt + Helm, plus deploying this docs site.
sidebar:
  order: 10
---

Deployment has two scopes that should not be confused:

- **Local app development** — running an app repo (Signals or Aggregator) on your machine for development. Covered in the [Installation](/bluedots-docs/guides/installation/local-stack/) guides.
- **Cloud deployment** — standing up the full stack on **AWS EKS** from the `bluedots-automation` repository. That is what this page covers.

For the architecture behind this flow, see [Infrastructure & Deployment Architecture](/bluedots-docs/core-concepts/architecture/infrastructure/); for how images get built and pinned, see [CI/CD & Build Pipeline](/bluedots-docs/guides/cicd-and-builds/).

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Minimum | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `aws` CLI | 2.x | AWS auth/STS, EKS kubeconfig |
| `tofu` (OpenTofu) | ≥ 1.6 | provision cloud resources |
| `terragrunt` | ≥ 0.90 | wraps tofu; per-module state |
| `kubectl` | ≥ 1.24 | talk to EKS |
| `helm` | ≥ 3.12 | install the charts |
| `bash`, `git` | 4.x / 2.x | run `install.sh`, clone |

Also required: an **AWS account** that can create VPC/EKS/IAM/S3 (plus an S3 bucket for OpenTofu remote state), a **GitHub PAT** with `read:packages` (`GHCR_PAT`) to pull images from GHCR, and **DNS control** for the public hostnames.

`yq` and a Makefile are **not** used — `opentofu/aws/<env>/install.sh` is the single entrypoint for both infrastructure and Helm.

## 1. Provision infrastructure

```bash
# pick / create an environment (template/ is the reference)
cp -R opentofu/aws/template opentofu/aws/<env>
cd opentofu/aws/<env>

# authenticate and confirm identity
aws sso login                  # or export static keys
aws sts get-caller-identity    # must succeed

# review environment inputs (region, EKS sizing, hosts, network, SMTP/SMS)
$EDITOR global-values.yaml

# one-shot infra bootstrap:
#   create_tf_backend → backup_configs → create_tf_resources → apply_gp3_default_sc
bash install.sh
```

This creates the remote-state bucket, runs `terragrunt run --all apply` (network → eks → iam → storage → random_passwords → output-file), writes the EKS kubeconfig, makes `gp3` the default StorageClass, and generates the three per-chart values files into the env directory.

Validate:

```bash
kubectl config current-context     # the new cluster
kubectl get nodes                  # Ready
kubectl get sc                     # gp3 (default)
ls common-services-values.yaml signals-values.yaml aggregator-values.yaml
bash install.sh preflight          # tooling + cluster + values files
```

## 2. Set required values

Some values are not auto-generated. Edit `global-values.yaml` **before** the final `terragrunt apply` (hosts, network), and the generated `signals-values.yaml` / `aggregator-values.yaml` **after** they're written but before deploy (Google Maps key, SMTP user/app-password, MSG91 keys, OpenAI key, admin emails).

:::caution
Re-running `terragrunt apply` on the `output-file` unit **overwrites** the generated values files. Set manual values after your final apply, or bake them into the module `.tfpl` templates.
:::

The aggregator's `global.signalstack.actingOrgId` is a **post-Signals** step — see step 4.

## 3. Deploy the stack

Deploy in strict dependency order. Either run the whole stack at once, or step through it gating on health.

```bash
export GHCR_PAT=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxx     # read:packages

# optional static checks (install nothing)
bash install.sh lint
bash install.sh dry_run

# full ordered deploy
bash install.sh deploy_all_services
```

`deploy_all_services` chains: `preflight → create_namespaces_and_secrets → deploy_monitoring → deploy_common_services → deploy_signals → deploy_aggregator → fix_acme_issuer_uri`.

Step-by-step equivalent (inspect health between releases):

```bash
bash install.sh create_namespaces_and_secrets
bash install.sh deploy_common_services    # Kong + cert-manager + Postgres + Redis
kubectl -n common-services get pods,pvc    # confirm Ready + bound BEFORE continuing
bash install.sh deploy_signals
bash install.sh deploy_aggregator          # Keycloak init runs after Postgres — slowest
```

Each `deploy_*` runs `helm upgrade --install … --wait`, so it blocks until that release's pods are Ready. It does **not** check cross-namespace dependencies — confirm common-services Postgres/Redis are Ready yourself before deploying Signals/Aggregator.

## 4. Set actingOrgId (after Signals)

```bash
cd opentofu/aws/<env>
ORG_ID=$(./get-signalstack-org-id.sh)      # network_service org id from the seeded DB
# set in aggregator-values.yaml:
#   global:
#     signalstack:
#       actingOrgId: "<ORG_ID>"
bash install.sh deploy_aggregator          # redeploy with the value set
```

Without it, aggregator login fails with `SIGNALSTACK_ORG_NOT_REGISTERED`.

## 5. Validate & point DNS

```bash
helm list -A                               # monitoring, common-services, signals, aggregator = deployed
kubectl get ingress -A                     # hosts match global-values.yaml
kubectl get clusterissuer letsencrypt-prod
kubectl get certificate -A                 # READY=True once ACME completes

# the Kong proxy LoadBalancer hostname to point DNS at:
kubectl -n common-services get svc common-services-kong-proxy
```

Point A/CNAME records for the signals API, signals UI and aggregator hosts at the **Kong proxy** LoadBalancer. Once DNS resolves and certs are `READY=True`, the public URLs are live.

## 6. Teardown

```bash
bash install.sh cleanup_all_services       # helm releases + namespaces, reverse order
bash install.sh destroy_tf_resources       # terragrunt run --all destroy (needs AWS creds)
```

:::danger
Deleting the `common-services` namespace deletes its Postgres + Redis PVCs (gp3 `reclaimPolicy: Delete`) — the EBS volumes and all data are destroyed. Back up first.

## Deploying this documentation site

This site is **Astro + Starlight**, deployed to **GitHub Pages** via GitHub Actions.

### One-time GitHub setup

1. Push the `bluedots-docs` project to a repository.
2. In **Settings → Pages**, set **Source = GitHub Actions**.
3. Confirm `astro.config.mjs` has the right `site` and `base`:
   ```js
   site: 'https://blue-dots-economy.github.io',
   base: '/bluedots-docs',
   ```
   For a custom domain (e.g. `docs.bluedotseconomy.org`), set `site` to that domain, remove `base`, and add a `CNAME` file in `public/`.

### The workflow

The bundled workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` builds with the official `withastro/action` and publishes on every push to `main`. After the first successful run, the site is live at the configured URL.

### Local preview

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev        # local dev server (under /bluedots-docs/)
pnpm build      # production build to dist/
pnpm preview    # preview the production build
```
